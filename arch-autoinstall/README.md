The purpose of this script is to automate the arch install process and allow a user to take a pre-existing barebones arch configuration and replicate it across a number of workstations.

Depending on your needs, you may need to make some alterations to the MODULES, HOOKS, DRIVE variables to get your system up and running.

As of now, the script does not automatically detect whether a system requires a BIOS or UEFI style setup, but this feature will be added shortly.
